*** MONTAUD & MISRACHI : From DNA to formation of proteins : how to align sequences ? ****
******************************************************************************************

——IMPORTANT—— the input plain text (.txt) file containing five lines of characters ( 2 DNA sequences and 3 amino-acid sequences ) is to be saved by the user in the “bin” directory under the name “sequences.txt”. If you would rather copy and paste your sequences we left an empty .txt file with the right name at the right place for you to use. If not simply replace it.

The program has been designed to briefly explain its different tasks as it is run.

You can decide wether to run each Task or not. When asked, answering with any string that starts with ‘y’ or ‘o’ will run the specified Task.

Necessary parameters are timely asked to the user via Java Scanners.

Basically, all you have to do is save the input file as described above and run the .jar file (unix command: java -jar filename.jar).

Wishing you a smooth run,

Raphaël & Gabriel
